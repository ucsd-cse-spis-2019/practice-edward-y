My name is Edward Yang and I am from Fremont, California. I'm in Warren College and I'm very excited to be here. I am interested in computer vision and artificial intelligence and is application in robotics. To be honest, I don't do that much outside of school except for hanging out with friends, playing flash games, and going to the gym. I want to be more involved so I'm up for recommendations on what to do.
